This project was created using create-react-app.

This is a halloween themed game, where you have to collect the falling objects (except the spiders) to get points.
Collecting the brooms, will 'award' you with -1 point, but it will accelerate the game's speed.

How to start the project:
1. npm install
2. npm run start
